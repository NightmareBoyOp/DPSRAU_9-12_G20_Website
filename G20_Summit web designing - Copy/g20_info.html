            <h2>What is G20?</h2>
            <p>The Group of Twenty, commonly known as G20, is an international forum for governments and central bank governors from 19 countries and the European Union.

The G20's primary objectives include fostering policy coordination, financial regulation, and addressing global economic issues.</p>

            <h2>History of G20</h2>
            <p>The G20 was established in 1999 in response to financial crises in the late 1990s. The group's inaugural meeting was held in Berlin, Germany. Over the years, G20 summits have played a crucial role in addressing global economic challenges, such as the 2008 financial crisis. G20 meetings are attended by heads of state or government, finance ministers, and central bank governors.</p>

            <h2>Recent G20 Meetings</h2>
            <p>In recent years, G20 meetings have focused on issues like trade tensions, climate change, sustainable development, and the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These meetings provide an opportunity for leaders to collaborate, discuss policy measures, and work towards global economic stability and prosperity.</p>
